# SoundController

A soundcontroller I use for all my games, will update this when I improve upon it. Edit it to how ever you wish. Be sure to create a new folder in workspace and name it "Sounds" (Capitalization required).
SoundLibrary should go into ReplicatedStorage along with SoundController but it can be placed anywhere you wish **(BE SURE TO CHANGE IT IN THE SCRIPT IF YOU GO WITH A CUSTOM LOCATION)**.
